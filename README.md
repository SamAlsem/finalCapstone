## Warehouse Program using OOP 

## Description
To help familiarise myself with OOP, and as the 5th capstone project of the course, I created a simple warehouse program with a number of applications. The idea behind this program is to image you work for a Nike warehouse, as a store manager and being responsible for stock taking, you build a simple program that makes stock take much easier. Every stock take stores the following information; country, code, product, cost, quantity and value. 

## Installation
In order to operate this program, you would need to have a Python readable IDE as well as tabulate imported 

## Usage
1. Once all installed and program run, you will be served with the main menu.
1. view - If view is selected you will be served with 2 options to view the data, object or tab.
1. object will provide the data pulled from the shoe object, this is raw in format.
1. tab provides the data in tabulated format for easier reading.
1. add - this allows for further shoe items to be added, user will be prompted to enter the following data inputs: 
country, code, product, cost, quantity and value - this information is appended to the shoe_list.
1. low - This will identify the shoe range with the lowest levels of stock in the list and provide the user with the option to order more stock, this value is then updated to the system.
1. search - this allows the user to search for a particular shoe range by shoe code.
1. value - this prints out the total value for each shoe item in the console by multiplying the value of the shoes by the number of pairs in stock.
1. quantity - this identifies stock where there are 40 or more pairs of shoes as a suggestion to put these up for sale
1. quit - quit the program
